# Gradient Domain Blending

**Edit Test_script.py with the path to your source, target and mask images**

***This is a basic implementation of gradient domain blending. We take the mask of the source image to be blended into the target image and calculate the gradient of the image in the masked region. Then we fill the space in the target image by reconstructing the gradient from the source image. Do try it on the sample images provided!***
